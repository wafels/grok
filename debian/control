Package: grok-jpeg2000-10-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Depends: grok-jpeg2000-10 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Description: development files for Grok, a JPEG 2000 image library
 Grok is a library for handling the JPEG 2000 image compression format.
 JPEG 2000 is a wavelet-based image compression standard and permits progressive
 transmission by pixel and resolution accuracy for progressive downloads of an
 encoded image. It supports lossless and lossy compression, supports higher
 compression than JPEG 1991, and has resilience to errors in the image.
 .
 This package contains the development files for Grok

Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: command-line tools using the JPEG 2000 library
 This package provides with command-line tools allowing for conversions between
 several formats:
 .
  - grk_decompress: decodes j2k, jp2, and jpt files to pgm, ppm, pnm,
                  pgx, and bmp.
  - grk_compress: encodes pnm, pgm, pgx, bmp, and ppm files to j2k,
                  and jp2.
  - grk_dump: dump information contains in j2k and jp2.
